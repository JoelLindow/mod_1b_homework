# Insertion Sort

My first attempt at writing an Insertion Sorting Algorithm.

I attempted to use Test Driven Development, however there were challenges I did not have time to address correctly. Although this program works, I still see the need for some significant refactoring when time allows for me to revisit this project.
I would comfortable refer to half of this code as "somewhat hacky".

In an effort to time-box this project and still see my family a bit through the weekend, this project must stand "as is" until more work time allows for significant refactoring.

However, the app does run correctly. I'm happy to have engaged in the challenge and am quite proud that it runs correctly. Enjoy!
