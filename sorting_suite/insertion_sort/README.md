# Insertion Sort

My first attempt at writing an Insertion Sorting Algorithm.

I attempted to use Test Driven Development, however there were challenges I did not have time to address correctly. Although this program works, I still see the need for some significant refactoring when time allows for me to revisit this project.
I would comfortable refer to half of this code as "somewhat hacky".
However, the app does run correctly. Enjoy!
